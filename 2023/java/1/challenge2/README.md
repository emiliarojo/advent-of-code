## Advent of Code Day 1 - Part 2

Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".

Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

two1nine <br>
eightwothree <br>
abcone2threexyz <br>
xtwone3four <br>
4nineeightseven2 <br>
zoneight234 <br>
7pqrstsixteen <br>

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.

What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
